# Hermetic-ish selftest for the IMP-012 framework-validate tiering. Uses the
# `--list-tier` DRY-LIST mode (no checks execute) so it is fast and non-circular.
# Proves: a known core check is WOULD-RUN under --list-tier=core; a known
# non-core check is WOULD-SKIP under core but WOULD-RUN under full; both exit 0;
# and an unknown flag exits 2.
