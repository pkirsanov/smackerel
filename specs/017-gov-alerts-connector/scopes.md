# Scopes: 017 — Government Alerts Connector

Links: [spec.md](spec.md) | [design.md](design.md) | [uservalidation.md](uservalidation.md)

---

## Execution Outline

### Change Boundary

**Allowed surfaces:** `internal/connector/alerts/` (new package), `config/smackerel.yaml` (add connector section), `config/nats_contract.json` (add ALERTS stream if not already added by weather connector).

**Excluded surfaces:** No changes to existing connector implementations. No changes to pipeline, search, digest, or web handlers. No new Go dependencies.

### Phase Order

1. **Scope 1: Proximity Filter & Alert Types** — Haversine distance calculation, location-based filtering, standardized alert type definitions, CAP severity mapping. Pure Go, no external dependencies.
2. **Scope 2: USGS Earthquake Source** — GeoJSON parser for USGS Earthquake API, magnitude filtering, proximity matching, alert normalization.
3. **Scope 3: NWS Weather Alerts Source** — JSON-LD/CAP parser for NWS Alert API, zone-based and point-based queries, severity classification.
4. **Scope 4: Gov Alerts Connector & Config** — Implement the `Connector` interface, multi-source sync orchestration, alert lifecycle management, config schema. Core connector with earthquake + weather alerts is end-to-end functional.
5. **Scope 5: Additional Sources** — Add NOAA tsunami, USGS volcano, InciWeb wildfire, AirNow air quality, and GDACS global disaster sources.
6. **Scope 6: Proactive Delivery & Travel Alerts** — High-severity alert routing to `alerts.notify`, travel destination alerting from calendar integration.

### Validation Checkpoints

- **After Scope 1:** Unit tests verify Haversine accuracy, proximity filtering at radius boundaries, severity classification logic.
- **After Scope 2:** Unit tests verify USGS GeoJSON parsing, magnitude filtering, earthquake alert normalization. Integration tests confirm real API responses parse correctly.
- **After Scope 3:** Unit tests verify NWS JSON-LD parsing, CAP field extraction, severity mapping.
- **After Scope 4:** Integration tests verify full sync flow: poll sources → filter proximity → normalize → lifecycle → publish to NATS.
- **After Scope 5:** Integration tests verify each additional source parses and normalizes correctly.
- **After Scope 6:** Integration tests verify proactive notification routing and travel destination alert matching.

## Scope 01: Proximity Filter & Alert Types

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** P0
**Dependencies:** None — foundational scope

### Description

Build the proximity filter (`proximity.go`), alert lifecycle manager (`lifecycle.go`), and shared alert types. The proximity filter uses the Haversine formula to calculate great-circle distances and filters alerts by user-configured location radii. The lifecycle manager tracks alert states (active, updated, expired, cancelled).

### Use Cases (Gherkin)

```gherkin
Scenario: SCN-GA-PROX-001 Filter by proximity radius
  Given user location "Home" at 37.77, -122.42 with radius 200km
  And an earthquake at 37.50, -122.10 (approximately 40km away)
  And an earthquake at 20.0, -155.0 (approximately 3800km away)
  When the proximity filter evaluates both alerts
  Then the first earthquake passes (40km < 200km radius)
  And the second earthquake is filtered out (3800km > 200km radius)
  And the match includes distance_km and nearest_location

Scenario: SCN-GA-LIFE-001 Alert lifecycle transitions
  Given a new alert with id "test123"
  When Process() is called for the first time
  Then the alert state is "new"
  When Process() is called again with identical content
  Then the result is "unchanged"
  When Process() is called with updated description
  Then the alert state is "updated"
  When ExpireOld() is called and the alert has passed its expires time
  Then the alert state transitions to "expired"
```

## Scope 02: USGS Earthquake Source

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** P0
**Dependencies:** Scope 1

### Description

Build the USGS Earthquake API client (`usgs.go`) that fetches real-time earthquake data as GeoJSON, filters by minimum magnitude, and converts to `RawAlert` structs.

### Use Cases (Gherkin)

```gherkin
Scenario: SCN-GA-USGS-001 Fetch earthquakes above minimum magnitude
  Given min_earthquake_magnitude is 2.5
  And USGS returns 50 earthquakes in the last hour
  And 15 are above M2.5
  When the source fetches alerts
  Then 15 RawAlert objects are returned
  And each has: ID, magnitude, latitude, longitude, depth, time, severity

Scenario: SCN-GA-USGS-002 Earthquake severity classification
  Given earthquakes:
    | ID | Magnitude | Distance from Home |
    | eq1 | 7.2 | 150km |
    | eq2 | 5.1 | 45km |
    | eq3 | 3.5 | 30km |
    | eq4 | 2.6 | 180km |
  When severity is calculated
  Then eq1 → "extreme" (M7+)
  And eq2 → "severe" (M5+ within 100km)
  And eq3 → "moderate" (M3+ within 50km)
  And eq4 → "minor" (M2.5+ distant)
```

## Scope 04: Gov Alerts Connector & Config

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** P0
**Dependencies:** Scopes 1, 2, 3

### Description

  Given earthquake and weather sources are enabled
  And location "Home" at 37.77, -122.42 with radius 200km
  When Sync() is called
