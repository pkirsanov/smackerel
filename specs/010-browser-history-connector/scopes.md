## Execution Outline

### Change Boundary

**Allowed surfaces:** `internal/connector/browser/connector.go` (new file), `internal/connector/browser/browser.go` (add cursor-based query + time helpers), `internal/connector/browser/connector_test.go` (new file), `internal/connector/browser/browser_test.go` (add tests for new functions), `cmd/core/main.go` (register connector), `config/smackerel.yaml` (add browser-history connector section).

**Excluded surfaces:** No changes to existing connector implementations (RSS, IMAP, CalDAV, Keep, YouTube, Maps, Bookmarks). No changes to existing pipeline processors, search API, digest API, health API, or web handlers. No new NATS streams. No new database migrations. No changes to `internal/config/config.go` — config parsing lives in the connector package (`connector.go`) consistent with Keep, Maps, and other connector patterns. No changes to `internal/connector/browser/browser.go` beyond the three new exported functions (`ParseChromeHistorySince`, `GoTimeToChrome`, `ChromeTimeToGo`).

### Phase Order

1. **Scope 1: Connector Implementation, Config & Registration** — Implement `Connector` struct wrapping existing browser.go utilities, add `ParseChromeHistorySince` cursor-based query to browser.go, copy-then-read SQLite access, skip filtering, dwell-time tiering, config schema + validation, registration in main.go. End-to-end sync of content URLs is functional.
2. **Scope 2: Social Media Aggregation, Repeat Visits & Privacy Gate** — Domain-level social media aggregation with individual processing exception for high-dwell reads, repeat visit detection with tier escalation, privacy gate (metadata-only entries become domain aggregates), content fetch failure handling.

### New Types & Signatures

```go
// internal/connector/browser/connector.go (NEW)
type BrowserConfig struct {
    HistoryPath                    string
    AccessStrategy                 string        // "copy" or "wal-read"
    InitialLookbackDays            int
    RepeatVisitWindow              time.Duration
    RepeatVisitThreshold           int
    ContentFetchTimeout            time.Duration
    ContentFetchConcurrency        int
    ContentFetchDomainDelay        time.Duration
    CustomSkipDomains              []string
    SocialMediaIndividualThreshold time.Duration
    DwellFullMin                   time.Duration
    DwellStandardMin               time.Duration
    DwellLightMin                  time.Duration
}

type Connector struct { id string; health connector.HealthStatus; mu sync.RWMutex; config BrowserConfig; ... }
func New(id string) *Connector
func (c *Connector) ID() string
func (c *Connector) Connect(ctx context.Context, config connector.ConnectorConfig) error
func (c *Connector) Sync(ctx context.Context, cursor string) ([]connector.RawArtifact, string, error)
func (c *Connector) Health(ctx context.Context) connector.HealthStatus
func (c *Connector) Close() error
func (c *Connector) copyHistoryFile() (string, error)
func (c *Connector) processEntries(entries []HistoryEntry, prevCursor int64) ([]connector.RawArtifact, string, syncStats)

// internal/connector/browser/browser.go (MODIFIED — additions only)
func ParseChromeHistorySince(dbPath string, chromeTimeCursor int64) ([]HistoryEntry, error)
func GoTimeToChrome(t time.Time) int64
func ChromeTimeToGo(chromeTime int64) time.Time

// internal/config/config.go (MODIFIED)
type BrowserHistoryConfig struct {
    Enabled      bool
    SyncSchedule string
    Chrome       BrowserChromeConfig
    Processing   BrowserProcessingConfig
    Skip         BrowserSkipConfig
    Privacy      BrowserPrivacyConfig
}
```

### Validation Checkpoints

- **After Scope 1:** Unit tests validate config parsing, `ParseChromeHistorySince` cursor-based queries, skip filtering, dwell-time tier assignment, copy-then-read file access, `Connect()`/`Health()`/`Close()` lifecycle. Integration test confirms full sync flow with a real SQLite fixture: connector starts → copies History → parses since cursor → filters → tiers → publishes `RawArtifact` → cursor persisted. E2E test confirms registration in main.go, conditional startup based on config, and artifacts appearing after sync.
- **After Scope 2:** Unit tests validate social media aggregation (domain grouping, high-dwell exception), repeat visit detection (frequency counting, tier escalation), privacy gate (metadata-tier → aggregate only). Integration test confirms full pipeline: social media domains produce aggregate artifacts, repeat visits get escalated tiers, short-dwell entries produce no individual artifacts. E2E test confirms searchability of high-engagement articles and correct social aggregate artifacts in store.

| # | Scope | Surfaces | Key Tests | DoD Summary | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Connector Implementation, Config & Registration | Go core (`browser/connector.go`, `browser/browser.go`), Config, `cmd/core/main.go` | ~14 unit + 3 integration + 2 e2e | Connector interface complete, cursor-based query works, config validated, registration wired, basic sync end-to-end | Done |

## Scope 01: Connector Implementation, Config & Registration

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** P0
**Dependencies:** None — wraps existing `browser.go` utilities

### Description

Implement the `Connector` struct in a new `internal/connector/browser/connector.go` that wraps the existing utility functions (`ParseChromeHistory`, `DwellTimeTier`, `ShouldSkip`, `ToRawArtifacts`) into the standard `Connector` interface (ID, Connect, Sync, Health, Close). Add `ParseChromeHistorySince` to `browser.go` for cursor-based incremental sync without the LIMIT 1000 cap. Implement copy-then-read SQLite file access strategy. Add config schema to `config/smackerel.yaml` and `internal/config/config.go`. Register the connector conditionally in `cmd/core/main.go`.

This scope covers the core vertical slice: a user enables the connector, configures a Chrome History path, and on sync, content URLs are tiered by dwell time, converted to `RawArtifact`, and published to the existing NATS pipeline with cursor persistence.

Social media aggregation, repeat visit detection, and privacy gate logic are deferred to Scope 2. In this scope, social media URLs and metadata-tier entries are still processed individually (as basic content entries) — Scope 2 adds the aggregation and privacy refinements.

### Use Cases (Gherkin)

```gherkin
Scenario: SCN-BH-001 Initial sync imports history with dwell-time tiering
  Given the browser history connector is enabled with a valid Chrome History path
  And the Chrome History file contains 200 URLs visited in the last 30 days
  And 15 URLs have dwell time ≥ 5 minutes
  And 30 URLs have dwell time between 2 and 5 minutes
  And 55 URLs have dwell time between 30 seconds and 2 minutes
  And 100 URLs have dwell time under 30 seconds
  When the connector runs its initial sync with an empty cursor
  Then the History file is copied to a temp location and parsed
  And 15 URLs are assigned "full" processing tier
  And 30 URLs are assigned "standard" processing tier
  And 55 URLs are assigned "light" processing tier
  And 100 URLs are assigned "metadata" processing tier
  And all qualifying entries are converted to RawArtifact and published
  And the sync cursor is set to the latest visit_time
  And the temp History file copy is deleted
  And connector health reports "healthy"

Scenario: SCN-BH-002 Incremental sync processes only new visits
  Given a previous sync completed with cursor "13350000000000000"
  And 25 new visits have occurred since that cursor
  When the connector syncs with that cursor
  Then only the 25 new visits are parsed via ParseChromeHistorySince
  And skip filtering and dwell-time tiering are applied to the 25 entries
  And the cursor advances to the latest visit_time among the 25

Scenario: SCN-BH-003 Skip rules filter non-content URLs
  Given the connector is processing history entries including:
    | URL                                    |
    | chrome://settings                      |
    | chrome-extension://abc123/popup.html   |
    | localhost:3000/dashboard               |
    | about:blank                            |
    | file:///home/user/notes.html           |
    | https://example.com/real-article       |
  When skip filtering is applied
  Then only "https://example.com/real-article" passes the filter
  And 5 URLs are skipped with reasons logged

Scenario: SCN-BH-004 Chrome History file not found reports health error
  Given the connector is configured with history_path "/nonexistent/path/History"
  And the file does not exist at that path
  When Connect() is called
  Then Connect() returns an error containing the configured path
  And health reports "error"

Scenario: SCN-BH-005 Copy-then-read strategy handles locked file with retry
  Given Chrome is running and its History file is temporarily locked
  When the connector attempts to copy the file and the first copy fails
  Then the connector retries once after 5 seconds
  And if the retry succeeds, sync proceeds normally
  And if the retry also fails, the sync cycle is skipped with an error
```

### Implementation Plan

**Files created:**
- `internal/connector/browser/connector.go` — `BrowserConfig`, `Connector` struct, `New()`, `ID()`, `Connect()`, `Sync()`, `Health()`, `Close()`, `copyHistoryFile()`, `processEntries()` (initial version without social aggregation/repeat detection/privacy gate — those are Scope 2), `parseBrowserConfig()`, `parseCursorToChrome()`, `goTimeToChrome()` (internal helper)
- `internal/connector/browser/connector_test.go` — Unit tests for all connector methods

**Files modified:**
- `internal/connector/browser/browser.go` — Add `ParseChromeHistorySince(dbPath string, chromeTimeCursor int64) ([]HistoryEntry, error)` (cursor-based query, ASC order, no LIMIT), `GoTimeToChrome(t time.Time) int64`, `ChromeTimeToGo(chromeTime int64) time.Time`
- `config/smackerel.yaml` — Add `browser-history` section under `connectors:` (disabled by default, all defaults documented)
- `cmd/core/main.go` — Import `browserConnector`, create `New("browser-history")`, register in registry, conditional `Connect()` + `supervisor.StartConnector()` when config enabled

**Components touched:**
- `Connector` interface implementation (wrapping existing `ParseChromeHistory`/`ShouldSkip`/`DwellTimeTier`/`ToRawArtifacts`)
- SQLite copy-then-read: `os.Open` + `io.Copy` to `os.CreateTemp`, `defer os.Remove`
- Config parsing: `SourceConfig` map → `BrowserConfig` struct with defaults and validation
- Cursor management: Chrome `visit_time` integer ↔ Go `time.Time` conversion, `StateStore` persistence

**Consumer Impact Sweep:** N/A — this is a new connector, no existing consumers affected.

## Scope 02: Social Media Aggregation, Repeat Visits & Privacy Gate

**Status:** Done
**Priority:** P0
**Dependencies:** Scope 1 (Connector implementation must be complete)

### Description

Enhance the connector's `processEntries` pipeline with three behaviors that refine how entries are classified and stored:

1. **Social media domain aggregation** — Group social media visits (detected via `IsSocialMedia`) by domain + date into single summary artifacts (`browsing/social-aggregate`). Individual processing only for social media entries with dwell ≥ 5min (configurable). This replaces the naive per-URL processing from Scope 1.

2. **Repeat visit detection** — Track URL visit frequency within a configurable window (default 7 days). URLs visited ≥ 3 times get their processing tier escalated by one level (e.g., `light` → `standard`). This captures deep-interest signals from repeated short visits that dwell time alone would miss.

3. **Privacy gate** — Entries at `metadata` tier (dwell < 30s) produce no individual artifact; they only contribute to domain-level visit count aggregates. Full URLs are stored only for `light` tier and above. This ensures casual browsing does not create a detailed URL-level trail.

### Use Cases (Gherkin)

```gherkin
Scenario: SCN-BH-006 Social media visits are aggregated at domain level
  Given the connector is processing history entries including:
    | URL                                        | Domain     | Dwell Time |
    | https://reddit.com/r/golang/post1          | reddit.com | 2m         |
    | https://reddit.com/r/golang/post2          | reddit.com | 1m30s      |
    | https://reddit.com/r/rust/post1            | reddit.com | 45s        |
    | https://twitter.com/user/status/123        | twitter.com| 30s        |
    | https://twitter.com/user/status/456        | twitter.com| 15s        |
  And none exceed the social_media_individual_threshold of 5 minutes
  When social media aggregation is applied
  Then one aggregate artifact is created for reddit.com with 3 visits and total dwell 4m15s
  And one aggregate artifact is created for twitter.com with 2 visits and total dwell 45s
  And the aggregate content_type is "browsing/social-aggregate"
  And no individual artifacts are created for these 5 URLs

Scenario: SCN-BH-007 Long social media read gets individual processing
  Given a single visit to "https://reddit.com/r/programming/long-post" with dwell time 8 minutes
  And 8 minutes exceeds the social_media_individual_threshold of 5 minutes
  When the connector processes this entry
  Then an individual "full" tier artifact IS created for this URL
  And this visit is excluded from the reddit.com domain aggregate

Scenario: SCN-BH-008 Repeat visits escalate processing tier
  Given the URL "https://docs.example.com/api-ref" has been visited 5 times in the last 7 days
  And each individual visit had dwell time of 90 seconds (normally "light" tier)
  When repeat visit detection runs
  Then the processing tier is escalated from "light" to "standard"
  And the artifact metadata includes "repeat_visits": 5
  And page content is fetched and extracted at "standard" tier

Scenario: SCN-BH-009 Metadata-tier entries produce only domain aggregates
  Given the connector processes 80 entries with dwell time under 30 seconds
  And those entries span 15 unique domains
  When the privacy gate is applied
  Then no individual artifacts are created for these 80 entries
  And the 80 entries contribute only to domain-level visit count metadata
  And no full URLs from these entries are persisted in the artifact store

Scenario: SCN-BH-010 Content fetch failure produces metadata-only artifact
  Given the connector is processing a "full" tier URL "https://example.com/article"
  And the HTTP fetch returns a 404 status
  When the content extraction is attempted
  Then a metadata-only artifact is created with the URL and title
  And artifact metadata includes "content_fetch_failed": true
  And the sync continues processing remaining URLs
```

### Implementation Plan

**Files modified:**
- `internal/connector/browser/connector.go` — Expand `processEntries()` to include:
  1. **Social media split:** After skip filtering, separate entries into social-media and content tracks via `IsSocialMedia(domain)`
  2. **Social media aggregation:** Group social entries by domain + date. Build one `browsing/social-aggregate` `RawArtifact` per group via `buildSocialAggregate()`. Exception: entries with dwell ≥ `SocialMediaIndividualThreshold` are moved to the content track for individual processing at `full` tier.
  3. **Repeat visit detection:** `detectRepeatVisits(entries)` builds a URL frequency map within `RepeatVisitWindow`. URLs exceeding `RepeatVisitThreshold` get tier escalated via `escalateTier()`.
  4. **Privacy gate:** Entries at `metadata` tier after all classification are excluded from individual artifact creation. Their domains contribute to visit count tracking only.
  5. **Content fetch error handling:** When HTTP fetch fails for `full`/`standard` entries, create artifact with title/URL metadata only and set `content_fetch_failed: true`.
  
  New methods on `Connector`:
  - `detectRepeatVisits(entries []HistoryEntry) map[string]int`
  - `escalateTier(tier string) string`
  - `buildSocialAggregate(domain string, entries []HistoryEntry, day time.Time) connector.RawArtifact`

- `internal/connector/browser/connector_test.go` — Add tests for social aggregation, repeat detection, privacy gate, content fetch failure

**Consumer Impact Sweep:** N/A — modifying internal processing pipeline of a new connector only.

**Shared Infrastructure Impact Sweep:** N/A — no shared fixtures or bootstrap changes.
